Before you come to the workshop, you are required to have Clojure installed, and your editor setup to write Clojure comfortably.
This should take half an hour of your time and will help us move at a smoother pace on the day of the workshop.

## Download and install Clojure and Leiningen
1. Ensure you're on Linux or Mac OSX.
2. Make sure you have Java version 1.6 or later installed on your laptop, if not then upgrade or install the latest version from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
3. Install Leiningen from http://leiningen.org/, which should also download Clojure for you.
4. Run `lein repl` to open up the Clojure REPL, and ensure it is working. Type in "I has Clojure" with quotes, it should print that string back.

## Editor
The preferred editor for the workshop will be emacs, as it is well suited to edit s-expressions. You are welcome to use an editor that you are comfortable with, but ensure good s-experession editing ability.

## Emacs
If you're new to emacs, and would like to use it in the workshop, Brave Clojure has a [great chapter](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/) on the bare essentials of writing Clojure with emacs. This also has instructions to download and install emacs on Linux and Mac OSX.
If you're already an emacs user, make sure you have clojure-mode, paredit, and cider installed.
