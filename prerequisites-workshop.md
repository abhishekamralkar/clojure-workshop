Here are a bunch of things you could do, before you come for the workshop. All in all this would just take up half an hour of your time and would help us move at a smoother pace on the day of the workshop.

- Make sure you have java version 1.6 or later installed on your laptop, if not then upgrade or install the latest version from here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- Once you have the required java version - install leiningen from http://leiningen.org/ : which would also download clojure for you.
- Once you have leiningen - try `lein repl` to open up the clojure repl to play around - if you want to.
- Once you are done we can setup an editor so that we can start writing clojure. We here at Nilenso prefer using emacs for clojure as it provides some kickass packages that makes writing clojure a lot easier. We would be using emacs for the workshop but you are welcome to use an editor that you are comfortable with.
- If you do decide to stick with emacs for the workshop then here are links to install emacs and a couple of emacs configs that you could use.
  - Install Emacs
    - http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Installing_Emacs_on_GNU/Linux
    - https://emacsformacosx.com
  - Some useful packages for emacs (if you already use emacs and just want to add packages)
    - cider
    - clojure-mode
    - paredit
    - auto-complete
  - If you are new to emacs or don't want to be bothered with picking and installing these you can use the below mentioned configs

- Alternatively you could use an editor that you are comfortable.
